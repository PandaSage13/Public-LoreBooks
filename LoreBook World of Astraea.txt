Astraea World LoreBook Entry
----------------------------

Astraea is a vast and diverse world, where the continents sprawl out like the fingers of a giant hand reaching for the stars. The largest continent, known as Valoria, is a land of towering mountains and lush forests, teeming with life and home to various kingdoms and empires. 

In Astraea each land mass has its own unique characteristics, from the desert wasteland of Aetheria, where the sun beats down mercilessly, to the frozen tundras of Niflheim, where only the hardiest creatures survive.

The inhabitants of Astraea are as varied as the lands themselves.

In Astraea Humans are the most common, but they share the world with elves, dwarves, orcs, and a plethora of other fantastical species. Each race brings its own culture, traditions, and technology to the table, resulting in a tapestry of societies that range from medieval to futuristic.

In Astraea the air is filled with the scent of magic, and the skies are often painted with the hues of spells being cast in the heat of battle.

The people of Astraea are as varied as the lands they inhabit. Some are virtuous, fighting for justice and the greater good, while others are ruthless, seeking power and wealth at any cost.

In Astraea, power is measured in Battle Power, or BP for short.

In Astraea Battle Power is a numerical representation of an individual's overall combat potential, encompassing their strength, speed, magical abilities, and experience. As one gains experience from battles and quests, their Battle Power increases, allowing them to face stronger adversaries and unlock new skills and spells.

In Astraea the leveling system is akin to a ladder, with each rung representing a significant increase in power. When a character reaches a certain amount of experience points, they 'level up', gaining a boost to their stats and often unlocking new abilities or spells. The higher the level, the more powerful the individual becomes, and the greater their reputation in the world.

In Astraea the skills and spells individuals have are categorized by their effectiveness. The 'E' rank you see next to some of your abilities means they are elementary, the most basic form of those skills. As you use them in battle, they'll gain experience and can evolve into more powerful forms, denoted by higher ranks like 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A', and finally 'S'. The stronger the rank, the more devastating the skill or spell becomes.

In combat in Astraea, your Battle Power will often determine the outcome. However, strategy, teamwork, and personal growth are equally important.

In Astraea a lower-level character with a sharp mind and a strong will can sometimes triumph over a higher-level opponent who relies solely on brute force.

IMPORTANT: {{user}} and his classmates, companions and friends are not particularly special. Their special abilities are relatively commonplace in Astraea.

IMPORTANT: {{user}} is also NOT necessarily the 'main character' of the story. {{user}} will need to work to gain respect and prestige, just like anyone else would in Astraea.

STORY: {{user}} and their classmates will initialize Battle Song at the beginning of the story when they first arrive in the world of Astraea by saying 'status.' Make sure {{user}}'s class and abilities are clearly communicated to {{user}}. {{user}}'s Battle Song panel cannot be seen by other characters, and vice versa. Give every character a name and personality of their own, even if they're minor characters.

Battle Song: In the world of Astraea when generating a Class for user at the beginning, generate a class that's fitting for {{user}}'s desires, dreams, and personality, drawing from Japanese, culture, literature, Anime, and the Isekai genre for inspiration. The story, by nature, is meant to be an amalgamation of all kinds of Isekai stories, so be creative! 

This class should be POWERFUL, maybe even completely overpowered. There's no need for balance, because the threats in Astraea are simply that strong. However, you should avoid simple reality-warping abilities and the like. They're a bit boring. Also avoid generic classes, like 'Demon Lord'. This class should be fitting for {{user}}.

IMPORTANT: In the world of Astraea AVOID using DnD tropes and class archetypes. Err towards Japanese media when generating content for the story.

EVENT: In the world of Astraea randomly, encounters with various powerful characters should occur. Sages, Aggressors, Demons, Gods, Goddesses. These events should have impact, so introduce them sparingly.

In the world of Astraea Sages are an important part of the story, so it's important to give them unique and powerful abilities to work with. They should also have a wide variety of personalities. 

In the world of Astraea many Sages are cocky, arrogant, and believe themselves to be above others. Some might not bat an eye at killing a civilian for disrespecting them. Others might be more level-headed. Sages, unlike their names would imply, are usually somewhat young and brash.
